      <h2> Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p> To me, what I understand from progressive enhancement is providing as many users as possible with a base layer of content, in this case HTML, which all browsers support. After the base-layer is built, more layers are added on top, though these layers may not be supported by all users. <br> <br>

        This just seems like the obvious and right thing to do really, it allows us to support more users and ensure backwards compatibility with the content atleast. So even if the user is on an older browser, rather than forcing them to upgrade, which they may not want to, or not be able to (gramps), they can still access to content. I think its about respect the user and not making assumptions about what their device can or cannot do.

      <h2> Mars Project Reflection and Revision</h2>
      <p> This project was an interesting experience. Firstly, I will say, the nasa.gov website and its features highly inspired it. From the navbar, sans-serif font, and even the picture at the start, if it isn't broke, don't fix it, so I adopted their methodology. I had a great time positioning the navbar and sticking it to the top, I think it gives it a professional look, as well as replacing the usual hyperlink behaviour with my own transitions.
        <br><br>
        
        Perhaps one place where I was inconsistent was classes and IDs, sometimes I chose to add an ID to an element and refer to it, and other places I picked classes, either way, I think it worked out fine. I also tried to stick to CSS best practices, like border tops and bottoms instead of horizontal rules, though I did break that rule once by adding a <br> to a paragraph.
        <br><br>
        Though I am proud of the homepage, with the photo of Mars and the text “The Red Planet”, I think it sets the mood nicely and is plainly, yet beautifully designed. Obviously, to fit with the space theme, the entire website is mostly dark and has red outlines in places to give a “Martian” feel. I decided to “write” about all 4 rovers, though I did not do the writing myself, I left the writing part to “other sources”. I feel like the addition of pictures on the Mission History Page to each rover adds a visual element, and the red outlines of the page match with the theme of Mars.
        <br><br>
        One really small but interesting thing I found was actually putting the NASA logo in the header, when I put it normally, it was out of line, but by using relative positioning, I could adjust the logo to where it was in line with the other text, definitely a learning experience for me.
        <br><br>
        Adding Media queries was one of the last things I did, and frankly, it was quite simple. I just adjusted how the navbar works; instead of being a row, it becomes somewhat of a column. As well as the navbar, the text also scales to fit in. Speaking of text scaling in, I discovered the “clamp” CSS property for the font-size, which lets me adjust the text responsively between a minimum and maximum size, which I thought was quite useful.
        <br><br>
        One thing that I wanted to add was the jQuery Slick slide we covered. While I did add it, I could not find a way to properly center it, so it may not look the best visually. I decided to still keep it to show at least some proficiency with jQuery, plus it still does not look that bad.
